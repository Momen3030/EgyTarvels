<p>Egypttraveltips.com is so interested in Egypt in general &amp; would like to give you in particular a brief about ancient Egypt,&nbsp;Egypt has a longer recorded history than any other country of the western world but inevitably its beginnings are shrouded in mystery &amp; doubt.There is a discussion upon the question whether the ancestors of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214163710/http://www.egypttraveltips.com/egyptian-10.html"><font color="#0404B4"><b>Egyptian</b></font></a>s were in origin <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214163710/http://www.egypttraveltips.com/african-13.html"><font color="#0404B4"><b></b></font></a><font color="#0404B4"><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214163710/http://www.egypttraveltips.com/africa-13.html"><font color="#0404B4"><b>Africa</b></font></a>n</b></font> or Asiatic. The question now may seem to be not of great importance,&nbsp;Like other people of antiquity, the Egyptians had no exact system of chronology, events being often dated according to the years of a king's reign. For this purpose the priests maintained long lists of kings, some fragments of which have survived: Abydos King List, Tablet of Karnak, Tablet of Saqqara, Turin Papyrus &amp; Palermo Stone. They are all about ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Lists of this kind provided the basis for the "History of Egypt" written by Manetho, a priest of Heliopolis in the reigns of Ptolemy I &amp; Ptolemy II, so Manetho was the first one arranged all the rulers of ancient Egypt from the 1<sup>st</sup> king , Menes, to Alexander the Great , in 30 dynasties.</p>
<p>Also much information on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214163710/http://www.egypttraveltips.com/egyptian--10.html"><font color="#0404B4"><b></b></font></a><font color="#0404B4"><b><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180214163710/http://www.egypttraveltips.com/egyptian--10.html"><font color="#0404B4"><b>Egyptian </b></font></a></b></font>history &amp; ancient Egypt can be collected from the accounts by Herodotus (c. 500-420 BC) &amp; Strabo (c. 63 BC-c. AD 25)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Prehistoric Period (before 60000 BC?!):</p>
<p>&nbsp;This period is still obscure.</p>
<p>* Early Period (about 3200 BC):</p>
<p>The earliest political organizations appear to have been the two kingdoms of Upper &amp; Lower Egypt, each of which was divided into nomes. This had happened more than 3000 BC when the Egyptian history officially began.</p>
<p>About 5200 years ago, the founder of Egyptian history, according to Manetho, was the King Menes, who united Upper &amp; Lower Egypt for the first time. No one knows for sure how he did this, but his action gave rise to Egypt's first stable dynasty. The powerful &amp; civilized reign of Menes suggests that civilization must have developing in the Nile Valley for many centuries before this time.Since Egypt was described, by Herodotus the Greek traveler &amp; historian, as "the gift of the Nile", this land has been capturing the imagination of all who visit it.The Nile River flows majestic &amp; serene, the lifeblood of Egypt as it has been since the beginning of history.</p>
<p>* Old Kingdom or Pyramids Age (c 2600 BC):</p>

<p>Much of Ancient Egypt may be seen without ever setting foot in the country. The progress &amp; the scale of the excavations combined with the extraordinary proliferation of the objects, large &amp; small, created by the Ancient Egyptians over an enormous period of time, have had the effect that their works are now scattered over all the civilized world.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In France there is the famous collection in the Louvre. Italy has considerable collections in the Vatican Museum &amp; at Turin. Te Berlin Collection was famous &amp; there are objects on view at Leiden in Holland &amp; at Athens. There is an exhibition in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York &amp; in the Museum in Brooklyn. In Britain the British Museum is famous. In Edinburgh, at Oxford &amp; Cambridge, At Liverpool there are Egyptian objects.</p>
<p>Of all these collections the most famous are the Louvre &amp; the British Museum, the reason for their pre-eminence being that it was the French &amp; the British who were able to get in first on the long-drawn-out business of removing Egypt's treasures.</p>
